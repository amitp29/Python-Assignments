10. Given a number line from -infinity to +infinity.
            You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right.
            The condition is that in iâ€™th move, you take i steps.
            In the first move take 1 step, second move 2 steps and so on. 
Hint: 3 can be reached in 2   steps (0, 1) (1, 3). 2 can be reached in 3 steps (0, 1) (1,-1) (-1, 2)
a) Find the optimal number of steps to reach position 1000000000 and -1000000000.
